		<H3>Why Forecasting?</H3>
		<p>
			The outbreak of an epidemic is a process that often needs
			to be controlled by authorities. At the same time
			numbers of infected people do not correspond to
			numbers of people which are confirmed diagnosed.
			Only the number of diagnosed people is available as
			confirmed data source while the number of actual
			infections can be significantly higher. <br><br>
			The faster the infection spreads the more difference
			is in between these two numbers and the more
			difficult it is to provide a solid method of control
			strategy. <br><br>
			It get's even more difficult if people are not
			diagnosable but infectious for a longer period of time either
			because infectious people do not show symptoms yet or
			symptoms are not strong in a large number of cases.
			<br><br>
			This is what is called a Dead Time System. A system
			that reacts on changes of its surrounding with a
			delay. Only after that delay changes get
			visible in numbers. So if authorities decide to
			apply restrictions trending of the infection rate
			will only change after that delay time. That makes
			it extremely difficult to make the right decisions.
			<br><br>
			Covid-19 is such a dead time system.
			<br><br>
			Making desicions without having a forecast that
			provides information about the results of
			that decisions (which are only visible in the future) 
			the whole process is prone to errors
			due to late action and following overreactions.
			<br><br>
			No forecasting can be perfect, in fact it can be
			totally wrong if some assumtions were wrong. But at
			least it can be possible to get an idea of how the
			system reacts on changes in principle. And in case
			the assumptions were right and the model parameters
			are stable, forecasting can provide a quite solid
			information for the near future, even if the results
			for distant future are totally wrong. And that
			information might be sufficient to make good
			decisions.
			<br><br>
			We could not find any good forecasting information for
			Covid-19 on the web. There are some good
			publications of mathematical models but
			unfortionately without real calculations with real
			numbers. So we made our own.
			<br><br>
			And again a disclaimer: We are not professionals in
			virology. We have a solid understanding of math and
			that is only a try to use the available numbers of
			cases to create a model that seems sufficiently
			accurate to us. A virus might behave different than
			we assumed. People in a country might behave
			different than we assumed. This can change
			everything and our calculation can be totally wrong.
			<br><br>
			SO DO NOT USE THESE RESULTS FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE
			THAN RESEARCH AND STUDY OF THE PHENOMENOM ITSELF.
		</p>
		<H3>What is a numerical time domain model?</H3>
		<p>
			Numerical modelling can provide solutions for
			problems that can not be solved by pure analytical
			solutions. Calculation of a numerical method is in
			general more simplistic than analytical methods
			which can invole highly complex formulas. Numerical
			modelling is the best choice for complex problems
			that need to be solved on a computer. Downside is
			the higher amount of calculations needed to get to a
			solution than it would be with an analytical
			approach.
			<br><br>
			Numerical modeling in time domain means that time
			is sliced in timeslots. For each timeslot a set of
			computations is performed to get the state of the
			system in the next timeslot. It sounds quite simple
			and in fact it is.
		</p>
		<H3>Assumptions</H3>
		<p>
			First we made some assumtions. The most important
			one is that there is no immunity at the beginning
			and everybody could possibly get infected (this
			might - hopefully - be wrong). So the
			number of infectable people at the beginning is
			exacltly the population of the country.
			<br><br>
			Another assumption is that the virus itself will not
			change a lot in terms of how easy it spreads under
			the same conditions. It is known by specialists that
			most viruses tend to get more likely to be spread as
			it mutates but we neglegt this for simplicity.
			<br><br>
			The third unknown is how many deaths
			are to be expected compared to the number of total
			infections. As authorities only count the number of
			diagnosed people there is definitely the possibility
			of dignosable people not getting a dignosis and so not
			being counted. But we had to decide which death rate
			to use in the model. We decided to use the number of
			0.5&percnt; which is known from South Korea. We
			think the lowest known number must be used in any
			calculation of death rates as all other countries
			which have higher rates just did not diagnose all
			diagnosable people. Of course this might also be the
			case in South Korea and so in fact we expect the
			actual rate of death to be even lower then
			0.5&percnt; when people get proper medical treatment. 
			Also we do not take into account that
			overloading of medical infrastructre may increase
			the rate of death at a later point in time.
			<br><br>
			As a calculation with large numbers we do not track
			down effects to single persons or single regions in a
			country. We expect the model to be a system of mean
			values. So numbers in some regions may be higher
			while being lower in some other regions.
			<br><br>
			Furthermore we implemented methodes to model social
			restrictions that are variable in time. We do not
			know the exact effect of different methods of social
			restrictions as nobody ever tried this before in
			Germany. So we do an estimation at this point.
			After some time the model is able to learn which
			type of social restriction causes which numerical
			reduction of infection rates. We are able to learn
			this from other countries that are ahead in time.
			But countries with different social, political and
			technical background cannot be compared to each
			other that simple. For example we assume that
			closing down schools will reduce the overall social
			activity by 20&percnt;. At this point in time we
			have no idea what amount of reduction further
			methods of restriction will bring.
			<br><br>
			Last it is assumed that one person can get the
			disease only once in the near future. The model
			assumes that once someone got the disease that
			person will either get immune after some time or die. 
			That person cannot get the disease a second time.
		</p>
		
		<H3>Data Sources and how calculation works</H3>
		<p>
			First we want to thank Johns Hopkins University for
			providing data of history of actual cases and deaths 
			for most countries in the world in a
			computer readable format on Github. This is our main
			data source. This work is greatly appreciated. 
			Please notice their terms of use for that data if
			you plan to use our calculation or results.
			<br><br>
			Now we want to explain how the model itself works. As
			described before we are using a numerical time
			domain model. We use a time slice width of one day
			as this also matches the rate of data in the
			repository of Johns Hopkins University. The model is
			calculated day by day. 
			<br><br>
			First the number of infectious people (people who
			are able to infect another person) for the
			current day is calculated by looking at the number
			of new infections in the last days. We define a time
			window in the history in which an infection must
			have been in order for that person to be infectious
			today. Then we count how many infectious people we
			have today (Forecast Infectious).
			<br><br>
			From the number of infectious people today we can
			derive the number of new infections today (Forecast
			new infections). This is
			simply done by multiplication of the number of
			infectious people times a constant which defines how
			many infectable persons will get infected in one day
			by one infectious person. That result is then multiplied
			with the ratio of infectable persons over the total
			number of population and multiplied with a factor of
			social interaction. The second multiplication takes
			into account that it gets less likely for an
			infectios person to find someone to infect who is
			susceptible for the disease as time goes by and more
			people get immune. The third multiplication enables
			us to reduce the factor of social interaction as
			authorities apply social restrictions. This factor
			starts with 1 and is reduced over time as
			restrictions are introduced.
			<br><br>
			Now we accumulate that number of new infections per
			day over history. This results in the estimated number of
			infections (Forecast Infected incl. Dead).
			<br><br>
			The number of estimated infectable persons (someone who is
			susceptible of getting the disease) is then simply
			calculated by subtracting the number of estimated
			infected people from the total population. This
			results in Forecast Infectable.
			<br><br>
			The number of people who could actually get a
			positiv test result (Forecast Diagnosable) in a diagosis is simple the
			curve of Forecast Infected delayed by 9 days. This
			has been assumed as the mean time between infection
			and diagnosis. The model has been trained by
			parameterization to fit that curve on the actual
			number of confirmed cases in history. After the
			parameters are derived that curve allows a forecast
			of confirmed cases for the near future.
			<br><br>
			The number of accumulated deaths (Forcast Dead)
			is calculated by the assumption that 0.5&percnt; of
			infections will result in death. So the curve of
			Forecast Infected (which should in fact be a rather
			accurate estimation of real infections) is
			multiplied by 0.5&percnt; and then delayed by a
			certain amount of time that is the mean time between
			an infection and death in case a person dies. This
			delay time has been derived from data of other
			countries to be around 14 days.
			<br><br>
			The forecast of ICU Load (people in need of
			intensive care) is a rectangle window function over the histoy
			of new infections. It is derived from a rolling sum
			over the history of new infections in an interval of
			icuDuration days mutliplied by a factor icuRate. icu
			Rate is the proportion of infected needing intensive
			care after some time.
			icuDuration is the mean time a person
			will stay in icu. That curve is then delayed by
			icuDelay because it takes some time from infection
			until intensive care is needed. This delay time is set
			to 9 days. The mean time a person will stay in icu
			is set to 15 days.
